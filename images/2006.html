<h1>20060930 - Free Hugs Campaign</h1>

<img src="../i/FreeHugs20060930.jpg" />

Sometimes, a hug is all what we need.
Free hugs is a real life controversial story of Juan Mann,
A man whos sole mission was to reach out and
hug a stranger to brighten up their lives.

In this age of social disconnectivity and
lack of human contact, the effects of
the Free Hugs campaign became phenomenal.

As this symbol of human hope spread accross the city,
police and officials ordered the Free Hugs campaign BANNED.
What we then witness is the true spirit of humanity
come together in what can only be described as awe inspiring.

In the Spirit of the free hugs campaign,
PASS THIS TO A FRIEND and HUG A STRANGER!
After all, If you can reach just one person...

------------------------------

PS. The response to this video has been nothing
short of overwhelming and touching.
Hugs to every single one of you who messaged.
There has been thousands of emails from all over
the world by people seeking to participate
in the Free Hugs campaign and asking for permission.
You do not need permission.
This is the peoples movement,
this is *your* movement.
With nothing but your bare hands you can make THE difference.

<h1>20060919 - My Berimbau</h1>

<img src="../i/MyBerimbau.jpg" />

동우한테 잠시 빌린다는 것이
현재까지 계속 가지고 있게 되었다.
줄은 중간에 약간 구부러져 완전히 펴지지도 않고
대는 너무 많이 휘어져서 줄을 팽팽하게 지탱시키지
못하고 대 중간쯤에 약간 금이 가서 타이로 묶어 놓았다.
소리를 높게 만들기 위해 하단에 타이로 바짝 묶어 놓았다.
가시시는 밑부분이 부서져 테입으로 감아 놓았다.
줄을 치는 긴 막대기는 처음에 너무 길고 무거워
칼로 짧게 그리고 얇게 잘랐다.
한결 가볍게 스피드를 구사할 수 있다.
최근에 산타마리아 리듬으로 연주하다가
띵(줄을 돌로 매우 쌔게 밀어 치는 소리),
팅(줄을 돌로 약간 밀어 치는 소리),
치(줄을 돌로 살짝 되어서 치는 소리),
똥(줄에 돌을 되지 않고 치는 소리)를
정확히 구별해서 칠 수 있게 되었고
산타마리아 리듬을 많이 좋아하게 되었다.
오늘 산타마리아를 연습하다가
이우나 리듬의 감을 조금 느끼게 되었는데
이때까지는 똥팅(또잉)을 짧게 해서 쳤는데
그게 아니고 까베샤를 배에서 밀었다가
다시 배쪽으로 당기면서 띵팅(띠잉)을 매우 짧게
치는 것 갔다.

{first 10-digist prime found in consecutive digits of e}.com

A billboard that can be found on Route 101, the heavily trafficked

No company logo, no recruiting pitch, just the equation.
The curious who solves it (Yep, it’s 7427466391.com) typed
the answer into their browsers and went to that Web page,
which offered another, harder problem (Don’t ask!)
that finally led to an invitation to interview at G-o-o-g-l-e.

        It was ten o' clock at night and still light. My husband Jay and I were sitting quietly beside a campfire at the edge of a small lake in a remote area of northern Canada. It was July and the northern latitude gave us light until eleven p.m. The brush pilot who had flown us there in a small plane had long since left. We were the only people camped around that small, isolated lake, the only people in the whole valley. You can imagine our surprise at hearing what sounded like a large rock being thrown into the lake. Closer scrutiny revealed that a large beaver slapped his tail on the surface of the lake was the "rock thrower." He was telling us that he was alarmed and displeased at our having camped so close to his home. The next day, we found his stick and mud lodge along the shore line. On subsequent evenings we would crouch behind the lodge and take photographs as the beaver family emerged to gather twigs from a nearby stand of aspen. Our chance encounter with the beavers led me to wonder about other accidental meetings. I let my sense of fun and whimsy be my guide and Whoo!? is the result.

Sunday is over.
We are all going home.
No reason to stay here.
But no one has made a move.

We know that for sure.
Nothing lasts forever.
But we have too many things
gone too fast.

Let's make a wish.
Easy one.
That you are not the only one.
And someone's there next to you
holding your hand.

Make a wish.
You'll be fine.

Nothing's gonna let you down.
Someone's there next to you holding you now.
Someone's there next to you holding you.
Along the paths you walk.

</p><h1>The Frill Necked Lizard  - 20060306</h1>

<img src="../i/TheFrillNeckedLizard.jpg" /><p>

      The Frill Necked Lizard is one of Australia's unique native
      reptile species you will find on an Australian outback 4x4 tour.
      They can bite but are generally harmless and are not poisonous.
      The Fill Necked Lizard is unique because he can change his appearance quite dramatically.
      He looks not unlike a normal medium sized garden skink, until upset.
      He then fluffs up his soft web-like neck skin to form an aggressive collar that is quite startling.

</p><h1>Rice-Barley Jellyfish  - 20060301</h1>

<img src="../i/rice-barley_jellyfish.jpg" /><p>

      I'd like to tell about a dream I had last night.
      I was on near a shallow sea.
      I saw the queer jellyfish.
      Its name is "rice-barley jellyfish".
      I don't know why I know its name.
      Its body is cylinder-shape, they have some body part have a stripes pattern.
      I think those are their legs, maybe.
      Oh, they are smilliar to <a href="http://songsungkyun.cafe24.com/images/images2005.html#tarantula">
      Maxican red kneed tranatula's</a> legs very much as well as color.
      And they have a transparent hemisphere-shape body part
      looks like a parabolic anenna.
      I don't know what it's for.
      As soon as I awaked from this dream,
      Hoping the jellyfish have that name exist,
      I searched "rice-barley jellyfish".
      Gosh~~, its doesn't exist, either.

      I watched natural documentary on TV.
      I had not seen a damselfly for long time, good time to see them.
      It came to mind that I had saw many dragonfly spawned
      on the inline-skate road on my way to the fitness center last fall.
      What's a pity.
      Maybe they mistook it for a lake.

      Tarsiers are small, nocturnal primates found in South East Asia.
      Several species are endemic to the island of Sulawesi including Tarsius pumilus,
      Tarsius spectrum and Tarsius dianae. They are found in primary and secondary rainforest.
      Tarsiers are characterised by their large, round eyes, long feet and long tails.
      They are the smallest primates known, measuring between 11 and 15cm in length and
      weighing only about 120g.
      They have long hindlimbs which allows them to jump between trees and adhesive pads
      on their digits to facilitate climbing.
      Their diet consists entirely of insects, which is unusual for primates

      The fish bowel is on the doorway in my office.
      Many kind and a lot of colorful fish are swimming in there.
      Then I'm interested in one kind of fish out of them.
      Their name is "Suckermouth Catfish".
      They are bigger than others and have a lot of queer spots.
      They usually cling to the small rock, glass wall and bottom.
      I think they don't like to swim around, just like to be motionless.
      Sometimes they take tiny pebbles mouth and then spit it out moving slowly on bottom.

      I'm searcing "poaching image" for some resaon on Google images.
      I had found a macaw image. Wow!! its color is fanstastic.
      Don't you think so? What's a beautiful.
      I post it right now.
      And I happend to know "poacher" another mean - a people to hunt wild animals illegally.
      And another means is a steamer.

      A neighbor's little boy showed me the a fish bowl.
      In there, about 10 diving bettles were swimming dizzily.
